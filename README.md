Step 1: Made the initial commit

Step 2: refactored code following DRY clean code concept:

1. Added two properties to make the function dynamic:

   - one for the date of choice
   - one for the element of choice

2. Replaced manually written date and elements with the above properties

3. Removed the second function as it has become redundant after the above code implementation.

4. Renamed the function to make it more readable
